# Typemaster-Landing-Page
## A really cool landing page 💡

This is my solution to the Typemaster landing page challenge from Front-end mentor. For this challenge, I wanted to learn the CSS framework Tailwind.

## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
